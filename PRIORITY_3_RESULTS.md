## System Architecture Validation

### Service Communication Flow
```
Client → API Gateway (8000) → Core Services
                            ├── Auth Service (8001)
                            ├── Memory Service (8003)
                            └── Registry Service (8005)
```

### Integration Points Tested
- Gateway routing to all core services
- JWT authentication across services
- Database persistence and retrieval
- Module registration and discovery
- Memory storage and retrieval
- Cross-service error handling

## Performance Metrics

- **Gateway Response Time**: Response time: 5162.27ms (too slow or failed)
- **Concurrent Request Handling**: 5/5 requests successful in 5675.70ms
