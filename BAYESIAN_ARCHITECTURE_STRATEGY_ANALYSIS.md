# Bayesian Framework Architecture Strategy Analysis

## Executive Summary

Analyzing three architectural approaches for the Bayesian framework, considering the strategic value of "Establishing Priors as a free audit" for prospect onboarding, similar to the successful PDP audit model in Surfacing.

## Strategic Context: Free Audit as Onboarding Tool

### The PDP Audit Success Model (Surfacing)
- **Free Value Delivery**: Immediate insights without commitment
- **Trust Building**: Demonstrates expertise and platform capabilities
- **Conversion Funnel**: Natural progression from audit to full engagement
- **Low Barrier Entry**: Reduces friction for prospects

### Bayesian Prior Audit Opportunity
- **Prior Elicitation Assessment**: Evaluate client's current belief structure
- **Domain Knowledge Validation**: Show data-driven evidence vs. beliefs
- **Conflict Detection**: Highlight where client assumptions may be wrong
- **Value Demonstration**: Quantify potential impact of better priors

## Architecture Options Analysis

### Option 1: Standalone Bayesian Analysis Service
**Best for: Free audit onboarding and specialized Bayesian workflows**

#### Advantages
✅ **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- Dedicated service for Bayesian operations
- Independent scaling and deployment
- Specialized team ownership

✅ **Perfect for Free Audits**
- Lightweight, focused service for prospect engagement
- Can be exposed publicly without full platform access
- Easy to package as standalone offering

✅ **Business Model Alignment**
- Clear pricing tiers (free audit → paid analysis → full MMM)
- Independent billing and usage tracking
- Can be white-labeled for partners

✅ **Technical Benefits**
- Optimized for Bayesian computations
- Independent technology stack choices
- Easier to maintain and update

### Option 2: Integrated Causal Service (Current Implementation)
**Best for: Seamless MMM workflow integration**

#### Advantages
✅ **Simplified Architecture**
- Single service to maintain

- Requires full causal service access
- Harder to isolate for prospect engagement
- Complex pricing model separation

❌ **Scaling Challenges**
- Bayesian computations affect causal service performance
- Harder to scale components independently
- Mixed concerns in single service

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
**Best for: Maximum flexibility and business opportunity**

#### Implementation Strategy

##### Shared Components (Current Implementation)
- [`shared/utils/bayesian_diagnostics.py`](shared/utils/bayesian_diagnostics.py:1) - ConflictAnalyzer, PriorUpdater
- [`shared/validation/simulation_based_calibration.py`](shared/validation/simulation_based_calibration.py:1) - SBCValidator, SBCDecisionFramework
- [`shared/models/bayesian_priors.py`](shared/models/bayesian_priors.py:1) - All Pydantic models

            attribution_result, request.client_priors
        )
        attribution_result.bayesian_validation = bayesian_validation
