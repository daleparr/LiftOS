## Overview

The LiftOS Agentic microservice implements a comprehensive data quality evaluation framework to ensure highly accurate outcomes in AI agent testing and evaluation. This process is critical for maintaining the reliability and trustworthiness of agent performance assessments.

## Data Quality Framework

### 8-Dimensional Quality Assessment

Our data quality engine evaluates data across **8 critical dimensions**, each weighted according to its impact on agent testing accuracy:

#### 1. **Completeness (20% weight)** 
- **Definition**: Measures the extent to which data is present and not missing
- **Evaluation**: Calculates missing value ratios at both dataset and column levels
- **Thresholds**: 
  - Excellent: â‰¥95% complete
  - Critical: <50% complete
- **Impact**: Missing data can lead to biased agent evaluations and incorrect performance metrics

#### 2. **Accuracy (25% weight)** - *Highest Priority*
- **Definition**: Measures how well data represents real-world values
- **Evaluation**: 
  - Outlier detection using IQR method
  - Range validation for domain-specific fields
  - Cross-validation against expected patterns
- **Thresholds**:
  - Outlier tolerance: <5% of values
  - Range violations: <2% of values
- **Impact**: Inaccurate data directly compromises agent testing results and performance metrics

#### 3. **Consistency (15% weight)**
- **Definition**: Measures uniformity of data format and representation
- **Evaluation**:
  - Format standardization across columns
  - Case consistency in text fields
  - Date format uniformity
- **Examples**: Mixed case names, inconsistent date formats, varying units
- **Impact**: Inconsistent data can confuse agents and lead to processing errors

#### 4. **Validity (15% weight)**
- **Definition**: Measures conformance to defined formats and business rules
- **Evaluation**:
  - Email format validation
  - Phone number pattern matching
  - Domain-specific rule compliance
- **Patterns**: Regex validation for structured data types
- **Impact**: Invalid data can cause agent failures and unreliable test results

#### 5. **Uniqueness (10% weight)**
- **Definition**: Measures absence of duplicate records
- **Evaluation**:
  - Duplicate row detection
  - Key field uniqueness validation
  - Cross-reference integrity
- **Thresholds**: <5% duplicate records acceptable
- **Impact**: Duplicates can skew agent performance metrics and bias evaluations

#### 6. **Timeliness (5% weight)**
- **Definition**: Measures how current and up-to-date the data is
- **Evaluation**:
  - Age analysis of timestamp fields
  - Data freshness assessment
  - Update frequency validation
- **Thresholds**: Data older than 30 days flagged for review
- **Impact**: Outdated data may not reflect current market conditions for marketing agents

#### 7. **Relevance (5% weight)**
- **Definition**: Measures applicability of data to the intended use case
- **Evaluation**:
  - Column utilization analysis
  - Value diversity assessment
  - Business context alignment
- **Indicators**: Empty columns, low-diversity fields, irrelevant attributes
- **Impact**: Irrelevant data adds noise and can degrade agent performance

#### 8. **Integrity (5% weight)**
- **Definition**: Measures referential and structural data integrity
- **Evaluation**:
  - Foreign key relationship validation
  - Data type consistency
  - Structural constraint compliance
- **Checks**: Orphaned references, type mismatches, constraint violations
- **Impact**: Integrity issues can cause agent processing failures

## Evaluation Process Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Ingestion and Normalization
```python
# Convert various data formats to standardized DataFrame
df = engine._normalize_data(input_data)
```

### Phase 2: Multi-Dimensional Assessment
```python
# Parallel evaluation across all 8 dimensions
dimension_results = await asyncio.gather(
    engine._evaluate_completeness(df),
    engine._evaluate_accuracy(df),
    engine._evaluate_consistency(df),
    engine._evaluate_validity(df),
    engine._evaluate_uniqueness(df),
    engine._evaluate_timeliness(df),
    engine._evaluate_relevance(df),
    engine._evaluate_integrity(df)
)
```

### Phase 3: Weighted Score Calculation
```python
# Calculate overall quality score using dimension weights
overall_score = sum(
    metric.score * weight 
    for dimension, metric in dimension_results.items()
    for weight in [dimension_weights[dimension]]
) / sum(dimension_weights.values())
```

### Phase 4: Critical Issue Identification
- Identify dimensions with CRITICAL quality levels
- Flag rule violations for critical business rules
- Generate prioritized issue list

### Phase 5: Recommendation Generation
- Automated improvement suggestions
- Prioritized action items
- Best practice guidance

## Agent Testing Validation

### Pre-Testing Quality Gates

Before any agent testing begins, data must pass these quality gates:

1. **Overall Quality Score**: â‰¥85%
2. **Critical Issues**: Zero critical issues allowed
3. **Key Dimensions**: Completeness and Accuracy must be â‰¥80%
4. **Business Rules**: All critical business rules must pass

### Marketing Campaign Data Validation

For marketing agent testing, additional validation includes:

```python
# Marketing-specific quality rules
marketing_rules = [
    DataQualityRule(
        rule_id="campaign_completeness",
        name="Campaign Data Completeness",
        dimension=DataQualityDimension.COMPLETENESS,
        description="Campaign data must be 98% complete",
        parameters={"min_completeness": 0.98},
        is_critical=True
    ),
    DataQualityRule(
        rule_id="performance_metrics_accuracy",
        name="Performance Metrics Accuracy", 
        dimension=DataQualityDimension.ACCURACY,

```

## Integration with Agent Testing

### Quality-Aware Test Execution

The agent testing framework integrates quality assessment:

1. **Pre-Test Validation**: Validate data quality before test execution
2. **Quality-Adjusted Scoring**: Weight agent scores by data quality
3. **Quality Context**: Include quality metrics in test results
4. **Conditional Testing**: Skip tests if data quality is insufficient

### Quality Impact on Agent Evaluation

- **High Quality Data (â‰¥95%)**: Full confidence in agent evaluation results
- **Good Quality Data (85-94%)**: High confidence with minor caveats
- **Acceptable Quality (70-84%)**: Moderate confidence, results require interpretation
- **Poor Quality (<70%)**: Low confidence, results may be unreliable

## API Usage Examples

### Basic Quality Evaluation

```python
from core.data_quality_engine import DataQualityEngine

# Initialize engine
engine = DataQualityEngine(config)

# Evaluate data quality
report = await engine.evaluate_data_quality(
    data=campaign_data,
    dataset_id="campaign_001",
    include_profiling=True
)

print(f"Overall Quality: {report.overall_score:.2%} ({report.overall_level})")
```

### Agent Testing Validation

```python
# Validate data for agent testing
is_valid, quality_report = await engine.validate_data_for_agent_testing(
    data=test_data,
    test_type="marketing_campaign"
)

if is_valid:
    # Proceed with agent testing
    test_results = await run_agent_tests(test_data)
else:
    # Address quality issues first
    print("Data quality insufficient for testing:")
    for issue in quality_report.critical_issues:
        print(f"- {issue}")
```
