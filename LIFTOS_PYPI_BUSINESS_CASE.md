# First-day value demonstration
roi_tracker = liftos.ROITracker()

before_liftos = {
    "monthly_revenue": 500000,
    "attribution_accuracy": 0.45,  # Industry average
    "budget_waste": 0.23  # 23% wasted spend
}

after_liftos = {
    "monthly_revenue": 634000,  # +26.8% from optimization
    "attribution_accuracy": 0.94,  # LiftOS causal accuracy
